Changes
=======

4.0b2 (unreleased)
------------------

- Adding a Windows OS environment variable 'TZ' will allow an  
  override for setting the timezone. The override timezone will 
  still be asserted for timezone validity and compared against 
  the systems timezone offset. 


4.0b1 (2021-08-21)
------------------

- Now finds and compares all the configs (under Unix-like systems) and
  tells you what files it found and how they conflict. This should make
  it a lot easier to figure out what goes wrong.


3.0 (2021-08-13)
----------------

- Modernized the packaging, moving to setup.cfg etc.

- Handles if the text config files incorrectly is a TZ file. (revanSZ)


3.0b1 (2020-09-21)
------------------

- Dropped Python 2 support
- Switched timezone provider from pytz to zoneinfo (PEP 615)


2.1 (2020-05-08)
----------------

- No changes.


2.1b1 (2020-02-08)
------------------

- The is_dst flag is wrong for Europe/Dublin on some Unix releases.
  I changed to another way of determining if DST is in effect or not.

- Added support for Python 3.7 and 3.8. Dropped 3.5 although it still works.


2.0.0 (2019-07-23)
------------------

- No differences since 2.0.0b3

Major differences since 1.5.1
.............................

- When no time zone configuration can be find, tzlocal now return UTC.
  This is a major difference from 1.x, where an exception would be raised.
  This change is because Docker images often have no configuration at all,
  and the unix utilities will then default to UTC, so we follow that.

- If tzlocal on Unix finds a timezone name in a /etc config file, then
  tzlocal now verifies that the timezone it fouds has the same offset as
  the local computer is configured with. If it doesn't, something is
  configured incorrectly. (Victor Torres, regebro)

- Get timezone via Termux `getprop` wrapper on Android. It's not officially
  supported because we can't test it, but at least we make an effort.
  (Jean Jordaan)

Minor differences and bug fixes
...............................

- Skip comment lines when parsing /etc/timezone. (Edward Betts)

- Don't load timezone from current directory. (Gabriel Corona)

- Now verifies that the config files actually contain something before
  reading them. (Zackary Welch, regebro)

- Got rid of a BytesWarning (MickaÃ«l Schoentgen)

- Now handles if config file paths exists, but are directories.

- Moved tests out from distributions

- Support wheels


1.5.1 (2017-12-01)
------------------

- 1.5 had a bug that slipped through testing, fixed that,
  increased test coverage.


1.5 (2017-11-30)
----------------

- No longer treats macOS as special, but as a unix.

- get_windows_info.py is renamed to update_windows_mappings.py

- Windows mappings now also contain mappings from deprecated zoneinfo names.
  (Preston-Landers, regebro)


1.4 (2017-04-18)
----------------

- I use MIT on my other projects, so relicensing.


1.4b1 (2017-04-14)
------------------

- Dropping support for Python versions nobody uses (2.5, 3.1, 3.2), adding 3.6
  Python 3.1 and 3.2 still works, 2.5 has been broken for some time.

- Ayalash's OS X fix didn't work on Python 2.7, fixed that.


1.3.2 (2017-04-12)
------------------

- Ensure closing of subprocess on OS X (ayalash)

- Removed unused imports (jwilk)

- Closes stdout and stderr to get rid of ResourceWarnings (johnwquarles)

- #34: Added support for /var/db/zoneinfo


1.2.2 (2016-03-02)

1.2.1 (2016-02-28)
------------------

- Tests failed if TZ was set in the environment. (EdwardBetts)

- Replaces os.popen() with subprocess.Popen() for OS X to
  handle when systemsetup doesn't exist. (mckabi, cewing)


1.2 (2015-06-14)
----------------

- Systemd stores no time zone name, forcing us to look at the name of the file
  that localtime symlinks to. (cameris)


1.1.2 (2014-10-18)
------------------

- Timezones that has 3 items did not work on Mac OS X.
  (Marc Van Olmen)

- Now doesn't fail if the TZ environment variable isn't an Olsen time zone.

- Some timezones on Windows can apparently be empty (perhaps the are deleted).
  Now these are ignored.
  (Xiaokun Zhu)

1.1 (2014-01-28)
----------------

- Adding better support for OS X.

- Added support to map from tzdata/Olsen names to Windows names.
  (Thanks to Benjamen Meyer).


1.0 (2013-05-29)
----------------

- Fixed some more cases where spaces needs replacing with underscores.

- Better error message on Windows if we can't find a timezone at all.


0.3 (2012-09-13)
----------------

- Windows 7 support.

- Python 2.5 supported; because it only needed a __future__ import.

- Python 3.3 tested, it worked.

- Got rid of relative imports, because I don't actually like them,
  so I don't know why I used them in the first place.

- For each Windows zone, use the default zoneinfo zone, not the last one.
