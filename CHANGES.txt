Changes
=======

1.2 (2015-06-14)
----------------

- Systemd stores no time zone name, forcing us to look at the name of the file
  that localtime symlinks to. (cameris)

------------------

- Timezones that has 3 items did not work on Mac OS X.
  (Marc Van Olmen)

- Now doesn't fail if the TZ environment variable isn't an Olsen time zone.

  Now these are ignored.

----------------

- Windows 7 support.

- Python 2.5 supported; because it only needed a __future__ import.

  so I don't know why I used them in the first place.

- For each Windows zone, use the default zoneinfo zone, not the last one.
