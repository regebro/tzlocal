  Python 3.1 and 3.2 still works, 2.5 has been broken for some time.

1.2.1 (2016-02-28)
------------------

- Tests failed if TZ was set in the environment. (EdwardBetts)

- Replaces os.popen() with subprocess.Popen() for OS X to
  handle when systemsetup doesn't exist. (mckabi, cewing)


1.2 (2015-06-14)
----------------

- Systemd stores no time zone name, forcing us to look at the name of the file
  that localtime symlinks to. (cameris)


1.1.2 (2014-10-18)
------------------

- Timezones that has 3 items did not work on Mac OS X.
  (Marc Van Olmen)

- Now doesn't fail if the TZ environment variable isn't an Olsen time zone.

- Some timezones on Windows can apparently be empty (perhaps the are deleted).
  Now these are ignored.
  (Xiaokun Zhu)

------------------

  (Thanks to Benjamen Meyer).


1.0 (2013-05-29)
----------------

- Fixed some more cases where spaces needs replacing with underscores.

- Better handling of misconfigured /etc/timezone.

- Better error message on Windows if we can't find a timezone at all.


0.3 (2012-09-13)
----------------

- Windows 7 support.

- Python 2.5 supported; because it only needed a __future__ import.

- Python 3.3 tested, it worked.

- Got rid of relative imports, because I don't actually like them,
  so I don't know why I used them in the first place.

- For each Windows zone, use the default zoneinfo zone, not the last one.


0.2 (2012-09-12)
----------------

- Python 3 support.
