Changes
=======

1.2.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Replaces os.popen() with subprocess.Popen() for OS X to
  handle when systemsetup doesn't exist. (mckabi, cewing)


1.2 (2015-06-14)
----------------

- Systemd stores no time zone name, forcing us to look at the name of the file
  that localtime symlinks to. (cameris)


1.1.2 (2014-10-18)
------------------

- Timezones that has 3 items did not work on Mac OS X.
  (Marc Van Olmen)

- Now doesn't fail if the TZ environment variable isn't an Olsen time zone.

- Some timezones on Windows can apparently be empty (perhaps the are deleted).
  Now these are ignored.

0.3 (2012-09-13)
----------------

- Windows 7 support.

- Python 2.5 supported; because it only needed a __future__ import.

- Python 3.3 tested, it worked.

- Got rid of relative imports, because I don't actually like them,
  so I don't know why I used them in the first place.

- For each Windows zone, use the default zoneinfo zone, not the last one.
